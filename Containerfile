# Remove duplicate files
# The thing is, the game symlinks "Degrees of Lewdity.html" to "Degrees of Lewdity ${GITSHA}.html",
# but when we copy files over to the caddy image, it follows the symlink resulting in two copies of the same file.
# So we need to remove the symlink and the duplicate file.

# Now we symlink the file to "index.html" so that caddy can serve it as the default page.
